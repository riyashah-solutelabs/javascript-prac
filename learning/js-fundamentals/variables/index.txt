<!-- A variable is a “named storage” for data.  -->

Constants
To declare a constant (unchanging) variable, use const instead of let:

const myBirthday = '18.04.1982';
Variables declared using const are called “constants”. They cannot be reassigned. An attempt to do so would cause an error:

const myBirthday = '18.04.1982';

myBirthday = '01.01.2001'; // error, can't reassign the constant!

When should we use capitals for a constant and when should we name it normally?

const pageLoadTime = /* time taken by a webpage to load */;
The value of pageLoadTime is not known prior to the page load, so it’s named normally. But it’s still a constant because it doesn’t change after assignment.

Summary
We can declare variables to store data by using the var, let, or const keywords.

let – is a modern variable declaration.
var – is an old-school variable declaration. Normally we don’t use it at all, but we’ll cover subtle differences from let in the chapter The old "var", just in case you need them.
const – is like let, but the value of the variable can’t be changed.
